              <p class="bio-p"> Ciao! 
              <br>My name is Filippo Venturini.I am currently a student at LEARN Academy, a full stack development bootcamp based in San Diego where I am developing a strong foundation to become a software engineer.         
              I was born and raised in Italy and have a strong passion for science and art.
              <br><br>I lived in Rome and Venice for college and I landed in California in 2015 thanks to my  grad school project and a job looking for <a href="http://www.natgeotv.com/ca/finding-the-lost-da-vinci ">Leonardo Da Vinci </a><br><br>
              I conducted research with structural and computer science engineers who developed software to improve the application of science to culture heritage. The results of this research were presented at the 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6BqMWPOqE&list=ULMNMoi5Af1SY&index=1451">TED global in Edinburgh</a><br><br>Additionally, I was involved in several research projects developing and improving analytical instrumentation and seeking innovative ways to solve art related mysteries. All this work led to a National Geographic documentary and several books to establish methodology and disseminate findings.<br><br>With a desire to further my education and skills, I moved to the US to pursue graduate studies in Chemistry. My research in graduate school included working on a Department of Defense (DoD) funded study to use lasers in detecting explosives. I also worked on a project to improve instrumentation using emerging technology such as 3D printing.<br><br><br>After earning my MS in Chemistry, I began working in the field of biotech using robots to automate experiments, at which time I became more curious about coding. I decided to leave the biotech field and pursue a career in the tech industry because I like to be challenged by solving new problems and to apply my critical thinking skills. I also like the idea that this field evolves rapidly, and you are continuously learning, growing, and you can reinvent yourself.</p>
